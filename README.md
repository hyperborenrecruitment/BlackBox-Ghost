# BlackBox-Ghost
Untraceable behavior anomaly detection model for secure internal systems.
## Overview  
BlackBox:Ghost is a synthetic environment used to test internal security protocols through behavior anomaly detection. The system was built to simulate compromised user activity and catch high-risk data movements in real-time.

## Features  
- Isolation Forest and KMeans for anomaly classification  
- Synthetic datasets mimicking real-world access logs  
- Real-time dashboard visualizations using Plotly  
- Modular codebase for adapting to different threat models  

## Tools Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow  
- PostgreSQL  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Plotly
